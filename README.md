# Mandelbrot set generator

We started this project in order to modelize mandelbrot set fractal for a mathematis research project. 

The set was find by [Benoit Mandelbrot](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Mandelbrot) in 1980.
It is composed of all Julia's fractals and has become a reference in the fractal domain for its details at infinite zoom.
